# Label Noise: Ignorance Is Bliss

Yilun Zhu, Jianxin Zhang, Aditya Gangrade, and Clayton Scott. Label noise: Ignorance is bliss. In *Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS)*, 2024

**To do**
- [ ] provide demo code
- [ ] release the code that could reproduce experimental result

Need to clean up the code, for now, run commends like:

`python main.py --noise_mode worst_label --feature_type foundation_model --encoder_name dinov2_vitl14 --batch_size 128`

to reproduce the results in the paper.
